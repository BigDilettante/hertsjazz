# Herts Jazz since 1969

Welcome to Herts Jazz's website. We've been presenting jazz since 1969 and continue to maintain only the highest standard of performers each week, both national and international.

Our gigs take place on SUNDAYS at The Maltings Arts Theatre in St Albans - a brilliant venue with capacity for 140.

See our history page for the club's background or go straight to our current list of gigs for this season.

The Herts Jazz Team wishes you a warm welcome and hopes that you can pay us a visit soon...
